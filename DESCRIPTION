Description: 
    Phantasus is a web-application for visual and interactive gene expression analysis.
    Phantasus is based on Morpheus â€“ a web-based software for heatmap visualisation 
    and analysis, which was integrated with an R environment via OpenCPU API.
    Aside from basic visualization and filtering methods, R-based methods such 
    as k-means clustering, principal component analysis or differential expression analysis
    with limma package are supported.
